We have transformed our small farm into 
a cosy location with a local food cafe 
and a few rooms for travellers. 
Some time ago this land was used by our
family for growing various plants and
animals. We have cared about this land
for decades and we are dedicated to make
it even better. Out small "traveller's 
island" is owned and managed by our family,
so by staying with us you support local
people. Our kids have grown and went on
to live in other parts of the world (one
of them helped us to make this website!).
We now enjoy staying on our land and
taking care of our guests. We would
be happy if you come to visit or stop
by on your way between the north (Laos, 
China) and the south (central and 
couthern Thailand), or just come
to visit Thung Chang and Nan for
our local <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/attractions">attractions</a>. 
See you!
