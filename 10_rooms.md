<p>
We currently have 3 cottages available for our guests.
Each cottage consists of two rooms (with separate entries) 
divided by an outside
deck of approximatelly one meter wide, which allows for a
comfortable noise isolation between the rooms (in case you
only book one of the rooms). The cottages are located
off the main road, facing the field with locally grown
fruit trees and other interesting plants, so you can be 
rest assured to spend a comfortable, calm night surrounded
by local nature. Each cottage comes with a dedicated
parking spot, so that you don't have to carry your
bags around and can have a quick access to all your
belongings left in the car. One of the cottages has
a small built-in kitchen, so if you are thinking
about cooking, please book the right cottage.
However, you don't have to worry about food at
all, as you can always have variety of local food,
freshly cooked for you at our
